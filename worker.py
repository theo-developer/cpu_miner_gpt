        wallet_address (str): The Monero wallet address to receive the mined coins.

To use this function, simply call it with the URL of your mining pool, your Monero wallet address, and the number of CPU threads you want to use for mining:
mine_monero("http://monero.pool.minexmr.com:4555", "your_Monero_wallet_address", 4)
Note that mining Monero using a CPU is not very efficient, and you will likely earn very little in the way of actual cryptocurrency. It's generally recommended to use a dedicated mining rig with powerful GPUs if you want to mine Monero profitably.
